What have I programmed?

This code is a simple financial calculator that helps you figure out how much money you will have in the future if you save some money every month and get some interest on it.

The program has two parts. One part is called calculate_wealth_by_year and it tells you how much money you will have after a certain number of years if you save some money every month and get some interest on it.

The other part is called calculate_years_till_freedom and it tells you how many years it will take for you to have a certain amount of money that will make you financially free.

To use the program, you just need to run it and answer some questions. First, it will ask you which part of the program you want to run - returns or freedom. Then, it will ask you some questions about how much money you have, how much you can save every month, and how much interest you can expect to earn.

If you choose returns, it will ask you how many years you want to save for and then it will show you how much money you will have at the end of each year.

If you choose freedom, it will ask you how much money you need to be financially free, and then it will tell you how many years it will take for you to save that much money.


Why did I build it?

I developed this financial calculator out of curiosity and a desire to explore the potential impact of different average salaries on an individual's long-term financial planning. I derive satisfaction from developing solutions to real-world challenges, and this code exemplifies my passion for leveraging technology to create practical applications. By enabling users to input their current savings, estimated rate of return, monthly savings, and target wealth, the program can generate projections and forecasts, aiding in informed decision-making around investments and financial planning.
